Create a cloud-based platform for teachers to upload and schedule - notes, flowcharts, diagrams, videos, presentations,
and others. Educators should be allowed to plan, organize, and display the curriculum for upcoming weeks for increased 
transparency.

Identify and execute apps that allow different users, such as—students, parents, and teachers—to post questions, 
reply to comments, and tag relevant subjects and users.
